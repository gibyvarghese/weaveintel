# weaveNotes — an AI-native research workspace (CRDT co-editing, voice, ink, agents) — Review & Phased Roadmap (mid-2026)

> **North star.** Turn geneWeave **Notes** into **weaveNotes**: a Notion / SharePoint-Pages-class
> workspace **built for AI agents and humans to co-manage research together** — where
> findings from chat runs, web research, meetings, files, and teammates are captured,
> structured, co-edited, cited, and published from one living document. It must do
> everything a best-in-class mid-2026 notes app does — block editing, real-time
> co-editing, voice capture + transcription, stylus/handwriting on iPad-class devices,
> AI-in-the-document, a workspace-wide RAG corpus with citations, and a great UI — and
> it must be **AI-native, not AI-bolted-on**: the agent is a first-class co-editor and
> the workspace is the agent's memory.
>
> **Scope of this doc.** (1) Review how Notes is implemented today. (2) Inventory the full
> feature set a 2026 AI notes app needs (researched). (3) Architect it as a **CRDT
> document spine** reusing weaveIntel's existing packages. (4) Decide **what is a
> package vs the app**. (5) Lay out a thorough **phased plan** (incl. emit-as-artifact,
> voice, ink, AI-in-doc, RAG, governance) with the **PWA-vs-native-iPad** boundary.

## 0. TL;DR / recommendation

- **Today, Notes is 100% app-only** (`apps/geneweave`), **no package**. A note is a
  Tiptap/ProseMirror JSON doc in one `notes.doc_json` column, **overwritten wholesale on
  every 1.5s autosave (last-write-wins)** → two tabs (let alone two users or the agent)
  **silently clobber each other**. No collaboration, no agent co-edit, no presence, no
  versioning, no voice, no ink, no RAG.
- **Yes — implement the reusable core at the package layer.** The CRDT document model,
  ProseMirror⇄blocks conversion, Markdown/HTML serialization, ink-stroke and
  transcript CRDT types, and the RAG/citation glue are app-agnostic, testable primitives
  → **extend `@weaveintel/coedit`** (and lean on `@weaveintel/retrieval`,
  `@weaveintel/memory`, `@weaveintel/voice`, `@weaveintel/graph`, `@weaveintel/artifacts`).
  The note feature, the trusted relay, persistence, UI, and capture connectors stay app-side.
- **The huge unlock: ~80% of an AI notes app is already built in weaveIntel.** We are
  mostly **assembling existing packages** (voice/STT, memory+retrieval RAG with
  field-level citations, knowledge graph, extraction, agents/workflows/triggers,
  artifacts + share/embed, the Phase 7 CRDT + trusted relay + presence + WS control
  channel, the `tools-*` capture connectors, governance) behind a block-editor shell —
  not building from scratch.
- **CRDT path (staged):** build a **home-grown block-document CRDT** on the Phase 7 RGA
  (zero-dep, fits our infra) for Notion-grade block editing + agent co-edit; keep
  **Yjs + y-prosemirror** as an isolated, opt-in **Phase 9 upgrade** for full
  rich-inline-formatting fidelity and 50+ concurrent editors. (mid-2026 research: Yjs is
  the only production Tiptap-collab binding and solves PM-position⇄CRDT mapping for you.)
- **PWA first, thin native iPad app later.** A PWA covers Apple-Pencil capture
  (pressure/tilt, ~120 Hz coalesced + predicted events shipped in Safari 18.2),
  mic-voice + streaming transcription, and all AI/CRDT (server-side). **Native iPad is
  only needed for** PencilKit-grade last-4 ms latency / Scribble, and **desktop/native is
  required for system-audio "ambient meeting" capture** (web `getDisplayMedia` only grabs
  tab audio).
- **The white space we can own:** no 2026 product unifies structured DBs + agents
  (Notion/Coda) **+** backlink/object knowledge-graph (Obsidian/Tana) **+** NotebookLM-grade
  source-grounded citations/provenance **+** Granola-style ambient meeting capture **+**
  GoodNotes-class stylus/ink. weaveIntel already has the parts to unify them.

## 1. How Notes is implemented today (evidence-based review)

### 1.1 Where the code lives — **app-only, no package**

| Concern | Location | Layer |
|---|---|---|
| Schema (5 tables) | `apps/geneweave/src/migrations/m46-agenda-notes.ts` | app |
| Row types + adapter interface | `apps/geneweave/src/db-types/adapter-agenda-notes.ts` | app |
| SQL implementation | `apps/geneweave/src/db-sqlite.ts` (`createNote`/`updateNote`/…) | app |
| REST API | `apps/geneweave/src/routes/me-notes.ts` | app |
| Editor (Tiptap) | `apps/geneweave-ui/src/ui/notes-editor.ts`, `notes-view.ts`, `notes-editor-bundle-entry.ts` | app UI |

There is **no `@weaveintel/notes` package**; nothing notes-related in `packages/*`. This is
the opposite of the Collaboration packages (presence/sessions/handoff/coedit) where the
reusable logic is a port + adapters and geneWeave is one host.

### 1.2 Data model (m46)
- `notes(id, owner_user_id, tenant_id, title, icon, cover, parent_note_id, sensitivity,
  doc_json, is_template, template_key, favorite, …)`. **`doc_json` = a full Tiptap/PM JSON
  tree.** Nesting via `parent_note_id`; templates via `is_template`; `sensitivity` ∈
  {normal, confidential, restricted}.
- `note_links(target_kind ∈ {note,run,agenda_item,task}, target_id)` — backlinks/@mentions.
- `note_databases` + `note_db_rows` — saved filtered/sorted views (table/board/calendar).
- Seeded **system templates** (meeting / weekly review / research) owned by `_system`.

### 1.3 Editing/save model — **last-write-wins overwrite (the core problem)**
- Tiptap editor (`@tiptap/starter-kit` + task-list/link/underline/placeholder/menus).
- **Autosave debounced 1.5 s** → `PATCH /api/me/notes/:id` writes the **whole `doc_json`**;
  `updateNote` overwrites it. **No merge, no base check, no op log.** Two tabs clobber.
- A `POST /notes/:id/extract` pipeline walks the doc for unchecked `taskItem`s → linked tasks.

### 1.4 The gap this roadmap closes
No concurrency safety; no agent co-edit; no presence; no offline reconcile / history; not
reusable; no voice; no ink; no in-doc AI; no workspace RAG; no publish-as-artifact.

---

## 2. Product vision — what "AI-native co-management" means

A weaveNotes document is a **shared context window** that humans and agents both read and
write. Concretely:

- **Agents are first-class co-editors,** not a chat box bolted on. An agent joins a note
  as a **CRDT peer** (Phase 7 pattern), draws on the **workspace RAG corpus** as memory,
  drafts **structured** content (headings, tables, to-dos — not just prose), cites its
  sources inline, and can run **scheduled / triggered** (a "research agent" that keeps a
  note current). It edits in **suggestion/track-changes** mode for big changes.
- **The workspace is the agent's memory.** Every note, run transcript, meeting, and file is
  chunked, embedded, and retrievable (hybrid vector + keyword) with **field-level
  citations** — so "summarize what we learned about X across all my research" works, and
  every claim links back to its source block.
- **Capture is ambient.** Findings flow in from chat runs (emit-to-note), web research, the
  web clipper, email, calendar, and **meeting recordings** (record → transcribe → AI turns
  the transcript into structured notes, Granola-style).
- **Input is universal.** Type, slash-command, dictate, or **handwrite with a stylus** on a
  tablet; handwriting and ink coexist with text and merge under the same CRDT.
- **Everything is publishable.** A note becomes an **artifact** (Markdown/HTML) with the
  existing **export / share / embed / public-link** machinery, redacted by `sensitivity`.

---

## 4. Architecture — the "one CRDT doc per note" spine

Everything hangs off **one collaborative document per note**, the Phase 7 trusted-relay
model generalized to rich blocks:

```
weaveNotes document (per note)
├── BlockDoc                      ← block-sequence CRDT (RGA over block ids) + per-block RGA text
│     ├── text / heading / list / todo / quote / code / callout blocks
│     ├── table block             ← rows/cells = nested CRDT maps
│     ├── ink block               ← InkDoc: append-only stroke-sequence CRDT (per-stroke ids)
│     ├── audio/transcript block  ← segments[{speaker,startMs,words[]}] + audioRef
│     ├── embed / synced block    ← references another block id (transclusion)
│     └── AI block                ← prompt + refreshFn + cached cited output
├── Awareness                     ← presence + coloured cursors (relative positions)  [Phase 7]
├── Op log + state vector         ← offline reconcile + version history               [Phase 7]
└── Peers: humans (u:<userId>:<device>) + agent (agent:<noteId>)                       [Phase 7]
```

- **Transport:** SSE ephemeral broadcast (`note.coedit.op`) + the Phase 6 **WS control
  channel** for cancel/steer/awareness; resumable via `Last-Event-ID`. (All shipped.)
- **Trusted relay:** the server holds the canonical `BlockDoc`, validates every op
  (anti-forgery namespace + size/flood caps — Phase 7 `validateClientOps`), persists,
  appends to the op log, and fans out. (Shipped pattern.)
- **The agent is a peer** (Phase 7 `createAgentPeer`) that emits **block-level ops** and
  reads the **workspace RAG corpus** as memory.
- **Materialized cache:** keep `notes.doc_json` as a read cache (ProseMirror JSON) updated
  on every applied op, so existing read paths and the editor keep working during migration.

### Package vs app placement (comprehensive)

**Package — extend `@weaveintel/coedit` (new modules):**
- `block-doc.ts` — `BlockDoc` CRDT (block-sequence + per-block `RgaDoc` + LWW attrs + ops:
  insertBlockAfter / **splitBlock** / mergeBlock / moveBlock / setBlockAttr; mark spans).
- `prosemirror.ts` — `pmToBlocks` / `blocksToPm` + deterministic **`normalize()` schema repair**.
- `markdown.ts` — `blocksToMarkdown` / `blocksToHtml` (+ `pmToMarkdown` legacy shim).
- `ink.ts` — `InkDoc` (append-only stroke-sequence CRDT; stroke = `{id, points[], pressure, tool}`).
- `transcript.ts` — transcript-segment types + merge helpers (segments are LWW-by-id).
- Contracts + fuzz convergence tests (mirror Phase 7).

**Reused packages (already exist):** `coedit` (RGA/awareness/agent-peer/validation),
`core` (SSE writer/parser, JSON Patch, ids), `retrieval` (chunker, **hybrid retriever**,
**citation extractor**, query rewriter), `memory` (pgvector/mongo, `fusedMemorySearch`,
**provenance**, dedup, corrections, retention, consolidation), `graph` (knowledge graph),
`extraction` (entities/tables/tasks), `voice` (STT pipeline + WS handler), `artifacts`
(emit + sqlite/fs backends), `collaboration` (Phase 2 sessions/tokens, Phase 4 comments),
`notifications` (@mention/share), `agents`/`workflows`/`triggers`/`skills`/`recipes`
(agentic), `routing`/`models`/`prompts`/`provider-*` (LLM), `cost-governor`/`guardrails`/
`redaction`/`scope`/`tenancy`/`identity`/`oauth`/`encryption`/`compliance` (governance),
`tools-browser`/`tools-gmail`/`tools-gcal`/`tools-gdrive`/`tools-onedrive`/`tools-slack`/
`tools-search` (capture), `react-client`/`ui-primitives` (UI), `mcp-server`/`mcp-client`.

**App — geneWeave (+ geneweave-ui, + a future native iPad shell):**
- `m100`: `note_docs` (BlockDoc snapshot + state vector) + `note_doc_ops` (op log); reuse/
  extend `notes`, `note_links`, `note_databases`. New: `note_shares` (or reuse Phase 2),
  `note_ink_assets`, `note_audio_assets`, `note_chunks` (RAG index) / reuse memory store.
- `note-coedit-sql.ts` trusted relay; `/api/me/notes/:id/coedit/*` endpoints.
- AI-in-doc endpoints (ask/continue/rewrite/summarize, AI-block refresh, `/research`).
- Workspace RAG endpoints (index a note on save; `/api/me/notes/search`; chat-with-workspace).
- Capture endpoints (emit run→note, clipper ingest, email ingest, voice/transcript ingest,
  meeting ingest).
- Emit-as-artifact endpoint (Markdown/HTML → `createArtifact`).
- UI: op-based Tiptap binding + NodeViews (ink/audio/AI/table/synced) + presence cursors +
  command palette + AI sidebar + capture surfaces + share/publish.

---

## 5. CRDT design (block-document) — recap + ink/voice

### 5.1 Block-document model (Option A, the default; mid-2026 BlockNote/Automerge shape)
```
BlockDoc = { order: SequenceCRDT<BlockId>, blocks: Map<BlockId, Block> }
Block    = { id, type, attrs: LWWMap, text: RgaDoc, marks: MarkSpan[] }
```
- **Convergence** reuses the Phase 7 RGA descending-id rule. **`splitBlock` is first-class**
  (allocate a new id, move tail chars **by id** — never string-concat) so a concurrent
  in-block insert at the split can't interleave the halves (Automerge's fix for the RGA
  interleaving weakness). If interleaving quality later matters, swap the order CRDT's
  tie-break to **Fugue** (a small delta on RGA) without touching the rest.
- **Schema repair:** `blocksToPm()` runs a deterministic `normalize()` (clamp cardinalities,
  wrap stray inline, coerce illegal nesting) so the editor never sees an invalid PM doc;
  **unknown block/mark types pass through verbatim** (no content loss on version skew).
- **Marks (bold/italic/link):** Peritext-lite spans `{startCharId, endCharId, type,
  expandLeft/Right}` anchored to text char-ids, so "bold a range" + "type inside it" commute.

### 5.2 Ink as a CRDT (Option A extends cleanly)
- `InkDoc` = an **append-only stroke sequence** (RGA over stroke ids); each stroke
  `{id:(counter,siteId), points:[[x,y,pressure,tiltX,tiltY,t]], color, width, tool}`.
  Concurrent appends are conflict-free; stroke edit/erase is LWW on the stroke object.
- Stored as a `BlockDoc` `inkCanvas` block whose attr points at the `InkDoc` (do **not**
  inline thousands of points in PM attrs). Rendered with **perfect-freehand**.

### 5.3 Voice/transcript as data (mostly LWW, not heavy CRDT)
- An `audioTranscript` block: `{audioRef, durationMs, segments:[{id, speaker, startMs,
  endMs, words:[{text,startMs,endMs}]}]}`. Segments are immutable-once-final (LWW by id);
  human edits to the rendered text become normal block-text ops. Click-a-word → seek audio.

### 5.4 Option B (Phase 9, frontier): Yjs + `y-prosemirror`
The only production Tiptap-collab binding; solves PM-offset⇄Yjs relative-position mapping,
schema-aware sync, awareness, undo. ~18 KB, no WASM. Adopt **behind the same `/coedit`
endpoints** for full rich-inline fidelity / 50+ editors; keep the home-grown path the
zero-dep default. (Reserve **Loro** — Fugue+Peritext, Rust/WASM, ~3× faster — for large-doc
perf walls.)

---

## 6. AI-in-document (reuse models / routing / agents / retrieval / memory)

- **Ask-AI / continue / rewrite / summarize / translate:** selection + doc context →
  `routing`-selected model via `prompts`; streamed back as **suggestions** (track-changes)
  so the human accepts/rejects. Schema-aware: the model emits **block ops**, not raw
  strings (avoids doc corruption).
- **AI blocks:** a NodeView with a stored prompt + a `refreshFn` (the Artifacts Live-Artifact
  pattern from the client roadmap) that re-runs against current doc + workspace context and
  caches a **cited** result.
- **Agentic `/research X`:** an `agents`+`workflows` flow — decompose → `tools-search` +
  workspace `retrieval` → synthesize a **structured** section (headings + a table) → write
  via block ops as the **agent peer**, every claim carrying a **citation mark** to its
  source block (provenance via `memory`/`retrieval` citations). Can be **scheduled** (a
  `triggers` job keeps the note fresh).
- **Workspace-as-RAG corpus:** on save, `retrieval.weaveChunker` chunks the note → embed →
  store (reuse `memory` pgvector); **hybrid** vector+BM25 retrieval (`weaveHybridRetriever`)
  with `weaveCitationExtractor` for grounded answers. Powers "chat with your workspace",
  **semantic backlinks/auto-linking** (`fusedMemorySearch`), and AI-block context.
- **Knowledge graph:** `extraction` (entities/relations) → `graph` for typed-object backlinks
  and multi-hop retrieval (LightRAG-style local+global).
- **Governance:** `cost-governor` budgets, `guardrails` + `redaction` on AI output,
  `scope`/`tenancy` isolation, provenance + confidence on every AI claim.

---

## 7. Emit notes as artifacts (Phase 4 — standalone, fast win)
- Package `markdown.ts`: `blocksToMarkdown` / `blocksToHtml` (+ `pmToMarkdown` legacy shim).
- App `POST /api/me/notes/:id/emit-artifact {format}` → `createArtifact({type,data,name,
  metadata:{source:'note',noteId,stateVector}})` via `@weaveintel/artifacts` →
  **instantly export / share / embed / public-link** (already shipped:
  `routes/artifacts.ts`, `routes/share.ts`). Respect `sensitivity` (a `restricted` note
  refuses public emission; reuse Phase 4 redaction); link back via a `note_links`
  (`target_kind:'artifact'`) row; re-emit = new artifact version. The agent can publish a
  co-written note via the existing `emit_artifact` tool path.

---

## 8. PWA vs native-iPad boundary (explicit)

| Capability | PWA (ship first) | Needs native iPad / desktop |
|---|---|---|
| Block editing, slash, command palette, dark mode | ✅ | — |
| Real-time co-edit, presence, offline (IndexedDB) | ✅ | — |
| AI-in-doc, agent-as-peer, RAG, citations (server-side) | ✅ | — |
| **Apple Pencil capture** (pressure/tilt, ~120 Hz coalesced + predicted, desync canvas) | ✅ (Safari 18.2+) | — |
| **Handwriting→text** | ✅ Chromium HWR API / server (MyScript) | Native **PencilKit/Scribble** for best on-device |
| Last ~4 ms ink latency, guaranteed ProMotion 120 Hz, Pencil hover | ⚠️ good-enough | ✅ native PencilKit |
| **Mic voice memo + streaming transcription + playback** | ✅ | — |
| **System-audio "ambient meeting" capture** | ❌ (tab-audio only) | ✅ **desktop/Electron** (Core Audio taps / ScreenCaptureKit) |
| Reliable **background** recording | ⚠️ iOS PWA limits | ✅ native |

**Plan:** Ship a high-quality **PWA** for everything except ambient-meeting capture and
PencilKit-grade latency; add a **thin native iPad app** (Track E) and a **desktop capture
helper** (Track D, Phase 11) as enhancements that talk to the same server/CRDT.

---

## 9. Phased plan

> Six tracks (A–F) interleaved into a phase sequence. Each phase is independently shippable,
> tested (positive/negative/stress/security), real-LLM Playwright e2e across modes, and
> committed — same discipline as the Collaboration roadmap. **Phase 4 (artifacts) and
> Phase 10 (voice) can start in parallel** with the foundation.

**Track A — Collaborative foundation**
- **Phase 0 — Notes substrate seam.** ✅ **delivered.** Built **`@weaveintel/notes`** —
  a `NoteRepository` PORT + an in-memory reference adapter + a shared
  `noteRepositoryContract` + pure `extractTaskItems`/`extractPlainText` helpers
  (lifted from the route). geneWeave provides `createSqlNoteRepository(db)` (a thin
  pass-through to the existing SQL, **passing the same contract**) and every
  `/api/me/notes/*` route now depends only on the port (injectable via
  `opts.noteRepository`). The legacy `doc_json` overwrite still works — **zero
  behaviour change** — so the Phase 2 CRDT relay can slot in as a new adapter behind
  the same seam. *Tested:* 25 package + SQL-contract units (round-trip, owner-scoping,
  cascade delete, search, links/databases, extraction positive/negative/stress); 8/8
  **real-LLM Playwright e2e** — a complex research run on **direct/agent/supervisor/
  ensemble** is captured into a note (from the seeded Research template), linked to
  the run, run through the to-do→task **extract** pipeline, plus databases/rows,
  favourites/search, owner-scoped security, the **Notes UI renders an API-created
  note**, and chat-stream regression. *Acceptance: identical behaviour — met.*
- **Phase 1 — `BlockDoc` CRDT (package).** ✅ **delivered.** Built the rich-text/block
  CRDT in **`@weaveintel/coedit`** on the **Automerge-style flat model** (one RGA
  sequence of `char | block-marker` elements, reusing the Phase 7 RGA verbatim — so
  split = insert a marker, merge = delete a marker; no trees, no char-moving). Two
  small LWW layers on top: block **attributes** (type/level/checked/listType, keyed
  by marker id) and inline **marks** (Peritext-lite spans anchored to char ids, so
  add/remove commute and survive concurrent edits). Plus `pmToBlocks` /
  `blocksToProseMirror` (+ deterministic `normalizeBlocks` **schema repair** — clamp
  heading levels, strip divider text, guarantee ≥1 valid block, **unknown
  nodes/marks pass through verbatim**), `blocksToMarkdown` / `blocksToHtml`
  (sanitized), and `createBlockAgentPeer` (the agent contributes its Markdown as
  block ops — Phase 7 agent-as-peer lifted to blocks). geneWeave wires a thin
  surface, **`GET /api/me/notes/:id/blocks?format=blocks|markdown|html`**, that runs
  a real note through the CRDT (via the Phase 0 `NoteRepository`). *Tested:* **18 new
  package units** — fuzz convergence (N replicas × random block+text ops shuffled +
  idempotent), concurrent block-insert + split-at-the-same-point convergence, **PM
  round-trip identity**, **adversarial-merge schema repair**, marks, Markdown/HTML
  serialization (incl. XSS-safe HTML), agent-as-block-peer, sync/snapshot (47/47
  coedit total). **7/7 real-LLM Playwright e2e** — a real research run on **direct/
  agent/supervisor/ensemble** is written as a rich note and round-trips through the
  BlockDoc with every block type, to-do checked-state, and bold/link marks intact,
  plus correct Markdown + sanitized HTML; owner-scoped security; malformed-note
  robustness; Notes-UI regression. *Acceptance: fuzz convergence + PM round-trip
  identity + adversarial-merge schema repair — all met.*
- **Phase 2 — geneWeave relay + co-edit + sharing + presence (app).** ✅ **delivered.**
  geneWeave is now the **trusted relay** for the Phase 1 `BlockDoc`: a note is co-editable
  by two humans (and, in Phase 3, the agent) at once. **`m100`** adds `note_coedit_docs`
  (canonical snapshot) + `note_coedit_ops` (append-only block-op log) + `note_shares`
  (membership) + `note_share_tokens` (256-bit, SHA-256-hashed invite links). **`note-coedit-sql`**
  holds the relay (`ensureDoc` seeds from the note's existing content, `submitOps` validates +
  applies + persists, `opsSince` for offline reconcile, `syncFromProseMirror` for diff-on-save)
  plus `resolveNoteAccess` (owner/collaborator/viewer) and the sharing manager. **`/coedit/*`
  endpoints**: `POST/GET /coedit`, `POST /coedit/ops` (collaborator+; viewers 403), `GET
  /coedit/ops?since=` (state-vector diff sync), `POST /coedit/sync` (diff-on-save), `POST
  /coedit/awareness`, `GET /coedit/events` (per-note **SSE** live broadcast via `NoteCoeditHub`),
  plus `POST /:id/share`, `GET /:id/share`, `POST /:id/share/revoke`, `POST /notes/join`. The
  legacy single-user `PATCH doc_json` is preserved for un-coedited notes and routed through the
  relay as a merge once a note is co-edited. **Package primitives** (reused, not app-specific):
  `validateClientBlockOps` (anti-forgery + caps for block ops) and `diffBlocks` (whole-doc →
  convergent ops). **UI**: the notes editor joins the live room, shows a "N editing" presence
  badge + a collaborator-edit refresh nudge, a **🔗 Share** button (mints a `?joinNote=` link),
  and routes saves through `/coedit/sync`; opening a share link auto-joins. *Tested:* a
  deterministic SQLite **relay integration suite** (9 — convergence, sharing/idempotent-join,
  revoke/expiry/exhaustion, offline reconcile, identity-forgery rejection, diff-on-save, a
  3-editor × 6-round **stress fuzz** that always converges) + **package units** (`validateClientBlockOps`
  positive/negative/security, `diffBlocks` structure + concurrent-no-clobber) + **real-LLM
  Playwright e2e (all four modes)**: two humans co-edit one real-LLM note → **converge, both
  edits survive**; viewer 403; forged site rejected; stranger 404; reload-no-loss + offline
  reconcile; legacy save still works; synced PATCH merges; **presence live over SSE**; and a
  **web-UI** test (Share button mints a link, saves route through the relay). *Acceptance: two
  humans co-edit → converge; reload mid-edit → no loss; offline reconcile; viewer 403; forged
  site rejected — all met.* (Known scope: live concurrent typing uses ops/`diffBlocks` from a
  synced replica; per-keystroke ProseMirror-step → op binding inside the Tiptap island and a
  Redis fan-out for multi-node SSE are documented follow-ups.)

**Track B — AI in the document**
- **Phase 3 — Agent-as-co-editor + AI actions + suggestions.** `note_edit` tool; agent peer
  emits block ops; ask-AI / continue / rewrite / summarize as **track-changes** suggestions;
  AI blocks (refreshFn); to-do⇄task extraction preserved. *Acceptance:* human + agent
  co-write one note → convergent merge; suggestion accept/reject; cited AI block refreshes.

**Track C — Workspace intelligence**
- **Phase 4 — Emit-as-artifact (package+app).** `blocksToMarkdown/Html`; emit endpoint →
  artifact → share/embed; `sensitivity` gating. *Acceptance:* note→Markdown artifact→public
  redacted link; restricted refused; agent can publish.  *(parallelizable)*
- **Phase 5 — Knowledge graph + backlinks + semantic auto-linking.** `extraction`+`graph`;
  `[[wiki-links]]`, backlinks/unlinked refs, graph view; `fusedMemorySearch` auto-links.
  *Acceptance:* entities/relations extracted; backlinks render; "related notes" surfaced.
- **Phase 6 — Databases/views + AI auto-fill + typed objects.** Extend `note_databases` with
  table/board/calendar/timeline/gallery + relations/rollups; AI fills properties from
  page+workspace+web. *Acceptance:* a view renders; AI auto-fills a column with citations.
- **Phase 7 — Capture & integrations.** Emit run→note; web clipper (`tools-browser`);
  email-to-notes (`tools-gmail`); calendar/file context (`tools-gcal`/`gdrive`/`onedrive`/
  `slack`); daily-jots inbox; scheduled "keep-this-note-fresh" agent (`triggers`).
  *Acceptance:* a chat run + a clipped page + an email all land as structured notes.
- **Phase 8 — Workspace RAG search + chat-with-workspace + version history + comments +
  synced blocks.** `retrieval`+`memory` over all notes/runs/files with citations; per-note
  version timeline (op log) + restore; block comments (Phase 4-collab); synced blocks/
  transclusion. *Acceptance:* "summarize what we learned about X" answers with click-to-source
  citations; restore an old version; a synced block updates everywhere.

**Track D — Voice & meetings**
- **Phase 10 — Voice memo + streaming transcription block.** Mic → AudioWorklet → WS →
  `voice` STT; `audioTranscript` block with word-timestamps + click-to-play; dictate-to-note.
  *Acceptance:* dictation transcribes live into a note; click a word seeks audio.
- **Phase 11 — Ambient meeting capture (desktop helper) + AI meeting notes + diarization.**
  Desktop/Electron system-audio capture → transcribe → diarize (pyannote/NeMo batch) → LLM →
  **structured** meeting notes (attendees/decisions/action-items→tasks). *Acceptance:* a
  recorded meeting becomes a structured, speaker-attributed, cited note with extracted tasks.

**Track E — Stylus / ink / canvas (PWA + native)**
- **Phase 12 — Ink block (PWA) + handwriting recognition.** Pointer-Events pen capture
  (coalesced+predicted, desync canvas, perfect-freehand); `InkDoc` collaborative strokes;
  ink→text (HWR API / MyScript server); OCR/PDF annotate (`extraction`). *Acceptance:* two
  users co-sketch an ink block → converge; handwriting converts to a text block.
- **Phase 13 — Infinite canvas / whiteboard + native iPad shell.** Embed tldraw (CRDT-backed)
  for whiteboard mode; thin **native iPad app** for PencilKit-grade latency/Scribble talking
  to the same server. *Acceptance:* whiteboard co-edits; iPad app reaches the same doc.

**Track F — Platform & polish**
- **Phase 9 — *(optional/frontier)* Yjs/`y-prosemirror` upgrade** behind `/coedit` for full
  rich-inline fidelity / scale; opt-in per tenant. *Acceptance:* concurrent range-formatting
  merges cleanly; 50-editor soak; home-grown remains the default.
- **Phase 14 — UX/platform polish.** Command palette, workspaces/sidebar, favorites,
  breadcrumbs, theming, export (pdf/docx), API/webhooks/MCP, mobile/tablet parity, a11y.

## 10. Security, governance & provenance (reuse Phase 1–7 + governance packages)
- **Trusted relay** validates every op (anti-forgery namespace `u:<userId>:<device>` + size/
  flood caps); **schema repair** guarantees a valid PM doc post-merge; **bounds/GC** on block
  + stroke + mark counts (server-coordinated, causal-stability gated).
- **AuthZ**: note owner + invited collaborators edit; viewers read-only; tenant-isolated;
  `sensitivity` gates public emission and AI exposure (`scope`/`tenancy`/`compliance`).
- **AI output**: `guardrails` + `redaction` + `cost-governor`; **every AI claim carries a
  citation + confidence + provenance** (`retrieval`/`memory`) — the anti-hallucination /
  auditability story, NotebookLM-/KnowQL-grade.
- **Capture**: OAuth-scoped connectors (`oauth`/`identity`); audio/ink assets encrypted at
  rest (`encryption`); GDPR retention/forget (`memory` expiry).

## 11. Testing strategy
- **Package:** convergence + **fuzz** property tests (the SEC proof), idempotency, causal
  delivery, offline reconcile, PM round-trip identity, adversarial-merge schema repair,
  markdown/html golden tests, ink/transcript merge tests. (Mirror `coedit/src/*.test.ts`.)
- **App:** SQL-relay contract + authorization/forgery/flood negatives; RAG citation
  correctness; emit-artifact + redaction; voice/transcript ingest; ink persistence.
- **Real-LLM Playwright e2e (all modes):** human+agent co-edit a note → byte-identical
  convergence; reload/offline reconcile; `/research` drafts a cited structured doc;
  emit-as-artifact + public share; chat-with-workspace cites sources; dictate-to-note;
  ink co-sketch; security (viewer 403, forged site, restricted-emission refused); UI regression.

## 12. Risks, non-goals, open questions
- **Rich-inline fidelity** is the main home-grown risk → Peritext-lite marks (P1) + Yjs
  escape hatch (P9). **Migration** of legacy `doc_json`→`BlockDoc` must be loss-free
  (round-trip tests + unknown-node passthrough). **System-audio capture** + **PencilKit
  latency** genuinely need native/desktop (scoped to Tracks D/E). **Open:** keep `doc_json`
  as a cache forever vs make the `BlockDoc` snapshot canonical (recommend: cache through P3,
  re-evaluate at P8). **Non-goals (initially):** real-time co-edit of database tables (P6+),
  pixel-perfect concurrent range-formatting (P9), full offline mobile parity (P14).

## 13. Appendix — evidence + weaveIntel package map + sources

**Current-implementation evidence (file):** `migrations/m46-agenda-notes.ts`;
`routes/me-notes.ts` (`updateNote` overwrites `doc_json`); `db-types/adapter-agenda-notes.ts`;
`db-sqlite.ts`; `geneweave-ui/src/ui/notes-editor.ts` (debounced 1.5 s full-doc PATCH),
`notes-view.ts`, `notes-editor-bundle-entry.ts` (Tiptap StarterKit + task-list/link/underline).

*Companion to `COLLABORATION_PACKAGE_REVIEW_AND_ROADMAP_2026.md`. The CRDT runtime,
trusted-relay, presence, transport, RAG/memory, voice, artifacts, agentic, and governance
primitives this roadmap reuses are already delivered as weaveIntel packages — weaveNotes is
largely an **assembly** of them behind a great block-editor UI, plus the new `BlockDoc`/ink/
transcript CRDT modules in `@weaveintel/coedit`.*
