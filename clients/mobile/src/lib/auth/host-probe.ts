/**
 * host-probe.ts — the production {@link HostProbe} built over the api-client.
 *
 * Lives in the pure-logic layer (no React / RN / expo) but does touch the
 * network via an injected {@link ClientFactory}: it spins up a throwaway client
 * with an empty token store and calls `getCatalog('mobile')`.
 *
 * Reachability semantics: the catalog endpoint requires auth, but the server
 * picker runs BEFORE sign-in, so a `401` is the expected (and desirable)
 * response — it proves the host is a geneWeave server that speaks the `/api/me`
 * protocol. We therefore treat both a resolved catalog AND an `AuthExpiredError`
 * (401) as reachable. Any other failure (connection refused, DNS, a non-geneWeave
 * response) is reported as unreachable — never propagated.
