 * SQL adapters for the core run-substrate ports (Collaboration Phase 0).
 *
 * geneWeave stores runs in `user_runs` and run events in `user_run_events`. Until
 * Phase 0 those tables were geneWeave's OWN parallel implementation of the run
 * registry + run journal that also (separately) lived in `@weaveintel/collaboration`.
 * Phase 0 makes the journal/registry a single CONTRACT in `@weaveintel/core`
 * (`RunJournal` / `RunRegistry` ports). These adapters make geneWeave's SQL
 * tables conform to that one contract — so the platform has one interface with
 * two interchangeable backends (the in-memory KV adapter in core, and this SQL
 * one), each proven by the same `runJournalContract` conformance suite.
 *
 * --- For someone new to this ---
 * A "port" is an interface (a list of methods); an "adapter" is a concrete
 * implementation of it. Here the port says "a run journal can append an event
 * and read events after a cursor"; this adapter makes those calls run against
 * SQLite instead of a key-value store. Swapping storage no longer means
 * rewriting callers — they only ever see the port.
