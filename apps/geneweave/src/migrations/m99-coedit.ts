/**
 * m99 — Collaboration Phase 7: CRDT co-editing (human + agent co-edit one doc).
 *
 * A "co-edit doc" is a shared text document attached to a run that a human AND
 * the run's agent can edit at the SAME time, always converging (a CRDT — see
 * `@weaveintel/coedit`). geneWeave is the TRUSTED RELAY: it holds the canonical
 * replica, validates every incoming edit, persists it, and fans it out live.
 *
 * Two tables (tenant-isolated by construction):
 *
 * 1. `coedit_docs` — one row per shared document. `snapshot_json` is the full
 *    CRDT state (every character + tombstone, in convergent order) — loading it
 *    reconstructs the exact replica. `state_vector_json` is the max op counter
 *    seen per site (for "what is a reconnecting peer missing"). `agent_written`
 *    tracks how many characters the agent peer has already contributed, so
 *    re-syncing the agent's streamed output is idempotent (never double-inserts).
 *
 * 2. `coedit_ops` — the append-only OP LOG: every insert/delete with its author
 *    site + Lamport counter (`op_site`/`op_counter` = the op's unique id). This
 *    is what lets an offline/reconnecting peer fetch EXACTLY the ops it missed
 *    (state-vector diff sync) instead of re-downloading the whole document.
 *
 * Security model (mid-2026 research — CRDTs are NOT Byzantine-tolerant, so the
 * server must enforce): an op's author site is derived from the authenticated
 * user (no forgery); ops are shape/size/flood validated before apply; only run
 * participants may edit; everything is tenant-scoped.
